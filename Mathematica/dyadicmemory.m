DyadicMemory realizes an associative memory for sparse hypervectors which has the functionality
of a Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) as proposed by Pentti Kanerva in 1988.

The present, highly efficient algorithm is based on a neural network with combinatorial connectivity.

The program stores and retrieves heteroassociations x -> y of sparse binary hypervectors x and y.

Sparse binary hypervectors are also known as Sparse Distributed Representations (SDR).

Here x and y are binary vectors of dimensions n1 and n2 and sparse populations p1 and p2, respectively. 

While in typical SDM usage scenarios n1 and n2 are equal, the present algorithm also allows asymmetric configurations.

The capacity of a symmetric memory with dimension n and sparse population p is approximately (p/n)^3 / 2.
For typical values n = 1000 and p = 10, about 500,000 associations can be stored and perfectly recalled.

Usage examples:

Create a memory instance: 		DyadicMemory[M, {1000,10}, {1000,10}]
Generate a random pair x->y:		r = M[]
Store r:				M[r]
Recall r:				M[First[r]]

Note that the sparsity of input vectors in the function calls for storing or retrieving an association
can take any value. The parameter p2 is only used to specify the target sparse population of the output
when recalling an association.
